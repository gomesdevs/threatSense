## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Setup
```python
# Threat detection thresholds
PACKET_THRESHOLD = 1000      # Packets/second for flood detection
ATTEMPT_THRESHOLD = 10       # Suspicious connection attempts
IP_REPEAT_THRESHOLD = 5      # Repeated IP access limit
```

from threatsense import ThreatDetector

detector = ThreatDetector(
    packet_threshold=1500,
    attempt_threshold=15
)
```
